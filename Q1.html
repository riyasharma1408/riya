	<hr size="8" width="90%" color="red">  
	<p>A network is defined as the connection of at least two computer systems, either by a <strong>cable or a wireless connection.</strong> 
         The simplest network is a combination of two computers connected by a cable. This type of network is called a <em>peer-to-peer network</em>. 
         There is no hierarchy in this network; both participants have equal privileges. 
         Each computer has access to the data of the other device and can share resources such as <u>disk space, applications or peripheral devices (printers, etc.).</u>
